# SafeHouse

SafeHouse is an application that is design to bring some peace of mind to every household. This application allows users to create a virtual representation of their household, add various consumer products, and receive recall information about the products that are a part of their household.

The application leverages the Amazon Consumer Product API and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC) Recall API.
